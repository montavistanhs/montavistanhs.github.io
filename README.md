INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING A NEW EVENT:

Update where ever there is "UPDATE" in caps.
- Set up data on Firebase project (date, description, hours, location, picture, time)
- Crop an image to 400x300 and put it in the images folder
- Copy and paste a current project card, changing the names of all the IDs and functions (image, title, description, button signup handler)
- Change the Firebase path in the body script to get the correct number of hours for the event
- Copy and paste a head script, changing the corresponding IDs and functions

TO ARCHIVE A PAST EVENT:
- Copy and paste both the event card, body button handler script, AND the head script to "past_events.html"
